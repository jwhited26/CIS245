# Class Project - Create an application that interacts with a web service
# in order to obtain data. Your program will use all of the information youâ€™ve 
# learned in the class in order to create a useful application. Your program must 
# prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from
# openweathermap.org. Your program must display the weather information in a READABLE 
# format to the user.
